====================================

A while ago, I was asked to complete some interview homework to create a numeral conversion tool for turning a passed number from 1-255 into a roman numeral.

This example code goes beyond that. It allows roman numerals of any (long) size. In addition, I have used dependency injection to demonstrate two other uses of the same pattern. In this module there are examples for medieval numerals, and I have applied the same pattern to US Currency.

This project contains example code for guice dependency injection, junit unit testing, and the previously mentioned numeral conversions.
