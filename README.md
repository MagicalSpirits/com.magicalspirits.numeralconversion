====================================

A couple of years ago, I was sent some interview homework having been asked to create a numeral conversion tool for turning a passed number from 1-255 into a roman numeral.

This example code goes far beyond that. It allows roman numerals of any (long) size, and also medieval numerals, and the same pattern can be applied to US Currency.

Example code for guice dependency injection, junit unit testing, and numeral conversion for the mentioned patterns.
