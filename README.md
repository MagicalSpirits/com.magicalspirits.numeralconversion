====================================

A couple of years ago, I was sent some interview homework having been asked to create a numeral conversion tool for turning a passed number from 1-255 into a roman numeral.

This example code goes beyond that. It allows roman numerals of any (long) size, and also medieval numerals, and I have applied the same pattern to US Currency.

This project contains example code for guice dependency injection, junit unit testing, and numeral conversion for the mentioned patterns.
